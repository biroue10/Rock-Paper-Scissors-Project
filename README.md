This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using Python. The project allows two players to compete against each other by making their choices and determines the winner based on the game's rules.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/biroue10/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd Rock-Paper-Scissors
   ```

## How to Play

1. The game prompts the players to enter their choices. Each player can choose either "rock," "paper," or "scissors" by typing the corresponding option and pressing enter.

2. Once both players have made their choices, the program determines the winner based on the following rules:

   - Rock beats scissors.
   - Scissors beat paper.
   - Paper beats rock.

3. The program displays the result of the round and asks if the players want to play again. Enter "Y" or "y" to play another round or any other key to exit the game.

## Additional Features

This project can be extended with various additional features, such as:

- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive gameplay experience.
- Keeping track of scores to determine the overall winner after multiple rounds.
- Adding more options to the game, such as "lizard" and "spock," and updating the rules accordingly.

Feel free to customize and enhance the project as per your preferences!
